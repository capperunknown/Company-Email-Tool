# Thank You Email Sender for Company Client 

For this specific company, I am required to send personalized follow-up "thank you" emails in which we show our customers some appreciation for being a loyal client. This process gets tedious so this program does the boring stuff by using a generic email template that fills in client data and outputs the finalized email to send into a text file. 

RAW, unformatted client data can be pasted in from an Excel sheet or can be pulled as a detailed AR report from MAGSTAR.
